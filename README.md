# 2018 Rails Survey
Rebuilt in React!

## Project Description
Almost ten years ago, Planet Argon invited the Rails community to participate in a survey about the state of hosting Ruby on Rails applications. Over the years, it has evolved to include questions about tools, frameworks, and workflows in order to see how the environment is changing.

The 2018 Survey is a snapshot of the highlights from this year's results, and also compares data from the past 4 Rails Hosting survey results, from 2009, 2012, 2014, and 2016. There is a download for the full 2018 survey results for interested users.
